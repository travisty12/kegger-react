# Kegger - React

### Created by **Travis Toal**, 4/19/19

## Planning
* The planned structure of components is as follows:
* ![component tree](src/assets/images/ComponentTree.jpg)
* The updated component tree, including state, is as follows:
* ![new component tree](src/assets/images/NewComponentTree.jpg)

# Development Notes
* React is being stubborn, creating lots of empty space despite my attempts to remove margin and padding.
* I'm unsure how I'll implement a login capability next week. I know I'll need to use state, which means I'll have to turn it into a classical program, but that means I can't use styling with consts.
* Styling is more complicated than it is in Angular. More specific, and easier to target components, but it requiring its own const per element adds up. Next week I want to implement the styled-components module, that should make things more concise.

## Description (current)
* This is a React project, mimicking a previous Angular project.
* The website is a mock page for a Taproom. It is currently static, but I plan on making it more dynamic and interactive.
* React is certainly more forgiving than Angular, in terms of how easy it is to make components. However, I find myself making a LOT more components than I did with Angular.
